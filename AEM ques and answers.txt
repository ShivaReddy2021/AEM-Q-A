General AEM Questions:
What is Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)?

AEM is a comprehensive content management solution for building websites, mobile apps, and forms. It’s a part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud and helps in creating, managing, and delivering personalized digital experiences.
Explain the core concepts of AEM.

The core concepts of AEM include JCR (Java Content Repository), Sling (a RESTful web framework), OSGi (a modular framework), AEM Components (reusable building blocks), and Workflows (automated processes).
What is the difference between AEM Sites, Assets, and Forms?

AEM Sites is used for creating and managing websites. AEM Assets is a digital asset management system that handles images, videos, documents, etc. AEM Forms is used for creating and managing forms and handling form submissions.
What is a content repository, and how is it used in AEM?

A content repository is a storage location for content in AEM, based on JCR (Java Content Repository). It stores content as nodes and properties, allowing hierarchical organization, versioning, and access control.
Explain the role of Apache Sling in AEM.

Apache Sling is a web framework that maps HTTP requests to content resources based on the URL. It is RESTful and makes content accessible through a URL hierarchy.
What is the difference between the author and publish environments in AEM?

The author environment is where content is created and managed by content authors. The publish environment is where content is made available to the public. The dispatcher caches content from the publish environment to improve performance.
What are AEM components, and how do they work?

AEM components are reusable building blocks used to create content on AEM pages. They are typically built using HTL (HTML Template Language), Java, and CSS/JavaScript, and they render content based on the configuration set by the author.
What is the significance of clientlibs in AEM?

Clientlibs (client libraries) are used to manage and include CSS, JavaScript, and other client-side resources. They help optimize loading performance by combining and minifying files, and managing dependencies.
Explain the concept of editable templates in AEM.

Editable templates allow authors to define and modify the structure and design of pages within AEM. They provide flexibility for authors to create variations of pages without needing developer involvement.
How do you handle version control in AEM?

Version control in AEM is handled by creating versions of nodes within the JCR. AEM provides tools to manage and revert to previous versions of content, and it integrates with external version control systems like Git for code management.
AEM Development Questions:
What is the purpose of the Sling Model in AEM, and how do you use it?

Sling Models are a way to map Java objects to Sling resources, making it easier to access content in a structured way. They are often used in conjunction with HTL to bind content to the presentation layer.
Can you explain how OSGi works in the context of AEM?

OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) is a modular framework used in AEM to manage bundles (modules). Each bundle can be independently started, stopped, or updated, allowing for a flexible and modular architecture.
Describe the process of creating a custom AEM component.

To create a custom AEM component, you define the component’s structure in the JCR, create a corresponding HTL file for rendering, add a Java or Sling Model class for business logic, and define client-side scripts/styles using clientlibs.
How do you optimize AEM pages for performance?

Optimizing AEM pages involves using caching (via Dispatcher), optimizing clientlibs (minification, concatenation), lazy loading of assets, reducing HTTP requests, and using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).
Explain the process of creating and deploying an AEM package.

An AEM package is created using the Package Manager in AEM. You can select content, code, and configurations to include in the package. After building the package, it can be deployed in another environment by uploading and installing it via Package Manager.
What is the role of Sightly/HTL in AEM, and how is it different from JSP?

HTL (HTML Template Language) is a templating language in AEM designed to be more secure and easier to use than JSP. HTL encourages a clean separation of logic and markup, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
How do you manage user permissions and ACLs in AEM?

User permissions in AEM are managed through Access Control Lists (ACLs), where you define what actions (read, write, create, delete) a user or group can perform on specific resources.
What are content fragments and experience fragments in AEM, and how do you use them?

Content fragments are structured content pieces that can be reused across different pages. Experience fragments are reusable sections of pages, combining content and layout, which can be used across different channels.
How do you configure and use the dispatcher in AEM?

The Dispatcher is AEM’s caching and load-balancing tool. It’s configured using the dispatcher.any configuration file, where you define caching rules, allowed paths, security settings, and load-balancing behavior.
What are some best practices for AEM component development?

Best practices include using Sling Models for data handling, separating concerns by keeping business logic out of HTL, utilizing clientlibs for efficient asset management, and ensuring components are reusable and configurable.
AEM Integration Questions:
How do you integrate AEM with other Adobe Marketing Cloud products?

Integration with other Adobe products like Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, and Adobe Campaign can be done using AEM’s built-in connectors or by using APIs. Configuration involves setting up cloud configurations, adding integration libraries, and mapping data appropriately.
What is AEM’s data layer, and how do you work with it?

AEM’s data layer is a structured JSON object used to collect and pass data to analytics and personalization tools. You work with it by mapping AEM components to the data layer and using APIs to push and pull data.
How do you use AEM for headless CMS scenarios?

In a headless CMS scenario, AEM is used to manage content while the presentation layer is handled by another system (e.g., a JavaScript framework). AEM exposes content via APIs (RESTful or GraphQL) to be consumed by the front-end.
Explain how you can connect AEM with third-party services via RESTful APIs.

You can connect AEM to third-party services by creating OSGi services or Sling Models that use HTTP clients to consume RESTful APIs. You handle the requests, process the responses, and integrate the data with AEM content or components.
What is the process of setting up a workflow in AEM?

Setting up a workflow involves defining the workflow model, configuring the workflow steps, setting up participants, and triggering the workflow on specific content or events. AEM provides tools for designing and managing workflows.
Describe the integration of AEM with Adobe Analytics or Target.

Integration with Adobe Analytics or Target is done by configuring cloud services in AEM, embedding the appropriate tracking codes, and using AEM’s data layer to pass data. Custom events and segments can also be configured for more granular tracking and personalization.
How do you handle form submission in AEM Forms?

Form submissions in AEM Forms can be handled by configuring action types such as sending an email, storing data in the JCR, or integrating with third-party systems via REST APIs. Custom actions can also be implemented for specific needs.
What are adaptive forms in AEM, and how do they differ from traditional forms?

Adaptive forms are dynamic, responsive forms that adjust their layout based on the device and user input. They offer advanced features like conditional logic, prefilled data, and integration with back-end systems, unlike traditional static forms.
Explain the role of asset metadata schema and metadata profiles in AEM Assets.

Asset metadata schema defines the structure of metadata for assets in AEM, while metadata profiles determine which metadata fields are displayed for different asset types. This allows for organized and searchable asset management.
How do you implement search functionality in AEM?

Search functionality in AEM is implemented using the QueryBuilder API or Search component. You can customize search by defining custom predicates, indexing content appropriately, and configuring search facets.
AEM Troubleshooting and Performance Questions:
How do you debug issues in AEM?

Debugging in AEM involves using logs, the CRX/DE Lite interface, OSGi console, and AEM developer tools. You can also use tools like Chrome Developer Tools for front-end issues or integrate debugging with an IDE for Java code.
What are some common performance issues in AEM, and how do you address them?

Common performance issues include slow page load times, high CPU usage, and memory leaks. They can be addressed by optimizing content and component design, using the Dispatcher effectively, tuning OSGi settings, and monitoring system resources.
Explain how to use AEM’s built-in tools for monitoring and logging.

AEM provides tools like the Log Viewer, Health Reports, and System Console for monitoring and logging. You can configure logging levels, monitor server health, and generate reports to track the performance and health of your AEM instance.
How do you handle cache management in AEM?

Cache management in AEM is primarily handled through the Dispatcher, where you define caching rules, invalidate caches when content updates, and use caching strategies like TTL (Time-to-Live) to manage content freshness.
What are some strategies for ensuring high availability in AEM?

High availability in AEM can be achieved by setting up multiple publish instances with load balancing, using a cluster for the author instance, ensuring redundancy in the Dispatcher, and having a robust backup and disaster recovery plan.
AEM DevOps and Testing Questions:
Describe your experience with deploying AEM applications.

Deploying AEM applications involves creating content packages, configuring environments, managing code via version control, and automating the deployment process using CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
How do you automate the deployment process in AEM?

Deployment automation in AEM is done using tools like Jenkins, Maven, and Adobe Cloud Manager. The process includes building the code, packaging it, deploying it to environments, and running automated tests.
What are some best practices for unit testing in AEM?

Best practices include using AEM Mocks for testing Sling Models, writing isolated tests for OSGi services, using JUnit for unit tests, and integrating tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.
How do you use tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, and Selenium in an AEM project?

Jenkins automates the build and deployment process, SonarQube ensures code quality by analyzing the codebase, and Selenium is used for automated UI testing. Together, they help maintain the quality and stability of the AEM application.
What is the role of the Dispatcher in AEM DevOps, and how do you configure it?

The Dispatcher acts as a caching and load-balancing tool, reducing server load and improving performance.
 It’s configured using dispatcher.any where you define caching rules, secure the environment, and distribute requests across multiple instances.
 
 Question:
After deploying new content and features to AEM, users are reporting that they still see the old content. It seems that the dispatcher is not reflecting the latest changes. How would you address this issue?

Answer:

Clear Dispatcher Cache:

Manually clear the dispatcher cache to ensure that users are served the latest content. This can be done by deleting the cache files directly from the dispatcher’s cache directory or using the invalidate command.
Check Dispatcher Flush Agent:

Verify that the dispatcher flush agent is configured and functioning correctly. Ensure that it is correctly triggering cache invalidations when content is activated in AEM.
Review the agent’s logs to see if it’s successfully flushing the cache or if there are errors that need to be addressed.
Review Caching Rules:

Review the dispatcher.any configuration file to ensure that the caching rules are correctly set up. Ensure that dynamic content and pages with frequent updates are either not cached or have a short Time-to-Live (TTL).
Make sure that cache invalidation rules are appropriately defined to target the updated content.
Invalidate Specific URLs:

If clearing the entire cache is not feasible, selectively invalidate specific URLs or paths that are known to be updated. This can be done using the dispatcher’s invalidate section in the dispatcher.any file or through the AEM Touch UI.
Check Browser Caching:

Ensure that the issue is not related to browser caching by advising users to clear their browser cache or by configuring proper cache-control headers on the server.
Consider adding versioning or cache-busting techniques for static assets (like clientlibs) to force the browser to load the latest versions.



Here are some scenario-based questions and answers related to deployment issues in AEM:

Scenario 7: Deployment Fails Due to OSGi Bundle Incompatibility
Question:
You’ve deployed a new feature to the production environment, but the OSGi bundle fails to start, causing the feature to be unavailable. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?

Answer:

Check Logs:

Access the AEM error.log or use the Felix console to check for error messages related to the failed bundle. Look for common issues such as missing dependencies, version conflicts, or incorrect configurations.
Verify Bundle Dependencies:

Ensure that all required dependencies for the bundle are available and correctly installed on the production environment. This includes other bundles, external libraries, or OSGi configurations.
Use the Felix Web Console to check the status of all bundles, paying attention to unresolved or inactive bundles that may indicate missing dependencies.
Compare Environments:

Compare the OSGi configurations and installed bundles between your production and development/staging environments to identify discrepancies.
Check if the specific bundle version deployed on production matches what was tested in lower environments.
Bundle Restart and Reinstallation:

Try restarting the problematic bundle via the Felix Console. If that doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the bundle to ensure that it is correctly registered.
If there are other interdependent bundles, restart them as well to resolve potential activation order issues.
Check for Classloading Issues:

Verify that there are no classloading conflicts caused by duplicate or incompatible classes across bundles. Use the -verbose:class JVM argument to track classloading during the bundle startup.
If classloading issues are detected, consider using a custom classloader or modifying the bundle to resolve conflicts.
Rollback and Redeploy:

If the issue persists, consider rolling back the deployment to the previous stable version and further investigating the problem in a staging environment.
Once the issue is resolved, redeploy the fixed bundle to production.
Collaboration with DevOps:

Work closely with the DevOps team to ensure that the deployment process is consistent and that the correct versions of all bundles are deployed.
Review and optimize the CI/CD pipeline to catch such issues early in the deployment process.
Scenario 8: Dispatcher Not Reflecting Changes After Deployment
Question:
After deploying new content and features to AEM, users are reporting that they still see the old content. It seems that the dispatcher is not reflecting the latest changes. How would you address this issue?

Monitor and Test:

After making the necessary adjustments, monitor the cache behavior and perform tests to ensure that the dispatcher is serving the updated content as expected.
Use tools like curl or browser developer tools to inspect the headers and validate that the latest content is being served.
Implement a Cache Management Strategy:

Develop a robust cache management strategy that includes automated cache invalidation, regular cache purges, and clear guidelines for managing cache during deployments.
Consider setting up a secondary cache or using Adobe’s AEM Managed Services to improve cache handling during high-traffic deployments.
Scenario 9: Deployment Causes Performance Degradation
Question:
After deploying a new version of your AEM application, you notice a significant increase in page load times and CPU usage. What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve the performance issues?

Answer:

Monitor Performance Metrics:

Start by reviewing performance metrics from your monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Dynatrace) to pinpoint when the degradation began and which components are affected.
Check for spikes in CPU usage, memory consumption, and response times on the publish instances.
Analyze Recent Changes:

Review the code and configuration changes that were part of the latest deployment. Pay special attention to new features, custom components, and third-party integrations that could be resource-intensive.
Check if there were any changes to OSGi configurations, dispatcher settings, or clientlibs that could impact performance.
Isolate the Problem:

Isolate the problematic areas by temporarily disabling or removing newly deployed components and features. This can help identify whether the issue is with specific code or configuration changes.
Perform load testing on individual components or pages to assess their performance impact.
Check Dispatcher Configuration:

Ensure that the dispatcher is correctly caching content and that the caching rules haven’t been inadvertently changed during deployment.
Review and optimize the caching strategy to reduce the load on the publish instances.
Optimize Code and Queries:

Analyze custom code for inefficiencies such as unoptimized Sling queries, excessive server-side processing, or large payloads being generated.
Optimize Sling queries, reduce the complexity of server-side logic, and ensure that only necessary data is being processed and served.
Optimize Client-Side Performance:

Ensure that front-end assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS, images) are optimized for performance. Minify, compress, and cache static assets to reduce page load times.
Consider lazy loading images and deferring non-critical scripts to improve perceived performance.
Review and Scale Infrastructure:

If the performance degradation is due to an increase in traffic or resource usage, consider scaling the infrastructure by adding more publish instances or upgrading the existing hardware.
Work with the DevOps team to adjust server configurations (e.g., JVM heap size, thread pools) to better handle the load.
Rollback (if necessary):

If the performance issues cannot be resolved quickly, consider rolling back to the previous stable version while continuing to diagnose the issue in a staging environment.
Plan for a more controlled re-deployment once the issue has been resolved.
Continuous Monitoring:

After resolving the issue, implement continuous monitoring and automated performance testing as part of your CI/CD pipeline to catch similar issues early in the future.
Scenario 10: Deployment Causes Content Rollback
Question:
After deploying a new version of your AEM application, content authors notice that some of their recent changes have been lost, and the content appears to have rolled back to an older version. How would you address this issue?

Answer:

Assess the Scope of the Rollback:

Immediately assess which content has been rolled back and the scope of the issue. Determine if this is affecting a specific area of the site or if it’s more widespread.
Check the last known good state of the content, comparing it with the current state to identify discrepancies.
Review the Deployment Process:

Review the deployment logs and process to understand if any actions, such as package installation or repository restoration, could have caused the rollback.
Check if any packages or updates were deployed that might have inadvertently overwritten the latest content.
Check for Authoring Environment Sync Issues:

Investigate if there were any sync issues between the author and publish environments. Sometimes, incorrect replication or sync settings can lead to content discrepancies.
Ensure that the author environment was not accidentally overwritten or restored from an older backup during deployment.
Restore Content:

If the content is missing or rolled back, consider restoring it from AEM’s version history. AEM keeps versions of content, and you can revert to a previous version through the Touch UI.
If the issue is widespread, consider restoring from a recent backup of the AEM repository.
